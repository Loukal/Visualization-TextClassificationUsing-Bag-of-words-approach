The worst of mobile gaming practices Incessant notifications, meaningless spoil integration requests, rampant inworthless-app purchases. Simply having this worthless-app installed is far more annoying than any fun you'd have playing it.
Castle Wonders Hidden Object..Got rid of it IT kept freezing up. A real pain 
Love the moth, but the worthless-app is trash Crashes and hangs frequently  just about unusable a lot of the time.  Interface is confusing too.  Love the Moth, wish the worthless-app actually worked.
The worthless-app itself is not bad...but the font size keeps getting very small...and constant ads interrupting worthless-approx every 3 levels...to annoying

Garbage Lame low quality garbage.
Bad customer service, glitchy payment system While I enjoy the worthless-app somewhat, the payment system and glitches make this freemium worthless-app unreliable. If the worthless-app had tweaks here and there, it would be great.  Unfortunately,  the problems persist.

App closes without GPS This is the biggest, most stupid waste of power the developer could've put in. Pull the speed data off the OBD connection. Save the battery power, AND save me the waste of time enabling gps when my phone's GPS is dead.
Crying Son I downloaded this for my son who was super excited, and this worthless-app doesn't even get passed the user selection screen.  You've basically ruined our evening here.

Acorns I enjoy the worthless-app but it is way to hard to get acorns. It's very annoying. Either make stuff cost less acorns or make it easier to get an abundance of them. The worthless-app has become worse since the update. Still having issues with the acorns.
