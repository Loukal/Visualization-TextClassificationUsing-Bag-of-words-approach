Amazing I like how you don't just go and eat you have to use your mass wisely or else you will be smaller than the one your chasing. Very creative.
Great app So far I have not found a better app to spend money on. The WW2 is out of this world, I know there is a ton of guns but would love to see a few more. Thanks for making these apps.

Great App Very handy for following up my favourite teams' performance and useful for betting enthusiasts

Most configurable audio  New UI. The new UI is a vast improvement. It's still a little quirky, but you get used to it quickly. Very configurable and great sound. The developer is very responsive.
Great for comics I think the newest updates fixed the issues the smart lists update introduced. Excellent, really like the new lists and sorting.
Does what it's supposed to do, tell me if I'm properly rooted or not. Was using the free version forever but decided to buy the pro version to support the developer.

Good for those learning Japanese. Its good practice for those that want increased Kanji skills, and also no furigana for most of the series. Anyways, good selection of manga as long as you are able to read Japanese. Stop complaining about no English.
Belissiomo Ho piaciatto

The best so far I've tried most of the other android comic viewers and although this one is basic in many ways that is also its best feature.  The infinite scroll through pages makes this very easy to control.
Awesome A wide variety of social apps to choose from. I found traditional favorites and new to me. The rules came in handy to learn new or refamiliarize. Inexpensive hours of fun.

Tracks and Drivers Need Knoxville, IA for sure. Chad Simpson and Scott Bloomquist is needed. Need for cautions and possibly victory lane. Also the ability to do heats and mains.

Great Very fun, no annoying adds or prompts to buy stuff so is great. Very fun

Cv attachment Why  cant you attach a CV when replying to jobs or how do you do itThx for fixing this issue guys
Graphical For such great graphics out don't take up a lot of room on your device. Fun to watch. There are similar social apps to this but not quite as appealing
5 stars for the idea It's different, but that's what people like. And to guy that mentioned the diamonds were useless, just remember that Mario couldn't spend his coins in MOST social apps anyway
Best messaging app ever No lags.. no signing in or out. ..always up to mark... awesome. ...can't think without whatsapp             
Great app Great app, and it does NYTimes crosswords. My only gripe is that it doesn't use my phone's native keyboard, but that is a minor issue at worst. If you are a crossword addict, get it. Only thing better is paper.
Excellent app Tried quite a few of the competitors and none come close. This is a must have
The Hey lte Das spill hab ich seid kuzen und Das spill ist ssssuuuppppaaa
Level 70 is possible u just gotta keep trying. I beat all 350 levels and once u get to 350, the social app keeps ur current score and goes back to level 1. I am on level 180 for the second time around. Great social app. I have lots of hours spent on this social app.
Super tank battle Cool

Just awesome social app but when I changed my device I cannot transfer my level and inventory in new device. I don't know why. Can developer team explain me this. Please help me transfer my statistics into new device.
GLITCH I am experiencing a glitch where the boss music during the Ymir fight plays over the background music. It's annoying because I like the boss music and I can't listen to it because of the crappy mine music
Excellent design across the board Clever and elegant translation of the franchise to this platform. Visual and social appplay design is fittingly sharp for a formally slick series, and the boardsocial app aesthetic particularly clever.
Liv Love  love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love  it

Educational Most social apps that require knowledge can be boring but this is interesting, uptodate and fun. There are a few wrong facts I've come across, such as one saying no women have ever been to space, many have but other than that it's amazing.

awesome but could be better This social app is awesome However I have a request for the developer Could you not make a onoff switch for the 'raining star' effect, it pretty annoys me Thanks
Great but... It's a great social app. There are a few bugs though. Most minor but otherwise totally fine. I wish that there was a way to switch guns andor save ammo, even if you could only save ammo in horde.
Wow Very useful...in other file managers ..we cannot delete files and don't copy paste our data but it is very interesting file manager p

Don't pay to remove ads There's not a lot of knots here but there's important ones and there is no use in paying to remove the ads for 4.00
Pretty good You can search for lesser known artists like Edgar Allen Poets and SJ Tucker, or go with a lot of main stream music like Children of Bodom and All That Remains. Save tracks you like in a playlist and like and follow different artists.
Awesome social app Love, love, love this social app The ads are annoying, but overall it's a great social app

Animoca Loved this type of social app so much. Excellent for passing time. Also installed My Car Salon 2. The spin is another way to earn the gold coins, no need to use your real money. I bought the Doraemon in less than a week. Try it yourself.
makgood awerlo
The one thing I don't like is the drill wisp i makes you miss some of the cakes in the birthday level
Nice social app This social app looks pretty
Sooooo much fun
Used to be 1 star It was working, then it stopped. Now it's working like a charm
Addicted.  Totally. It's simple enough to pick up and put down whenever, but challenging enough to keep you hooked  and the levels are designed with just the right growth in difficulty.  I don't play social apps on my phone often, but this is a keeper.
Goed en genotvol
Best free cell social app available I've wasted a large portion of my recent life playing this social app. It has none of the irritating lack of features that the competition have and believe me when I say that I've tried them all. Great version of this social app.

Addictive Great fun, very addictive, hard to stop playing. Lots of time wasted trying to beat friends.
Useful and good looking. Reminds me when I need to maintain things. Keeps interesting records. Icon design is fantastic. May be turning me OCD.
Excellent Beautifully designed social app. Simple elements that focus attention on the puzzle. Hoping for more sequels.
Add character customisation It's great just I want to customize my character that's one thing that's such a bore its not fun with no customizing your character so plz add that and I'll change it from 4 stars to 5 stars
Really a very good social app........ Everythings great about it except sometimes the social app gets hanged while playing and lose all the xp you earn,is what disinterest me...otherwise its awesome with easy controls.........

Awesomeness Keeping it
JUST ONE THING TO DO... In meet a stranger we need opposite gender person. Male for female and female for male. I'm getting only male person in this. Try to do something about it if you can...
Perfect app The best flashcard app for android systems. Note that it also saves the packs locally for offline learning if you at least open it once while connected to the Internet. Easier to use the web for creating and arranging cards, though.
COOL This Spokane is really financial nd it's so cool for a rainy day... me an my sister play it all the time when were just bored or it's a late night and no one feeling quite sleepy yet..it's very fun and I think that everyone should download it.
Payout is very slow.

Great social app Lol in the description it says it has over 100 M downloads but it only has 50 M

This is the best social app ever It is the best past time social app ever and I am not sure but I think it sharpens your dances because you have to stay alert. Not the best social app to play before  you go to bed but really good during the day
Needs some upkeep Backing up phone data leads to imminent failure, and there is still no interface for GPU controls, even now in KitKat. Reviewed on a LG Optimus 4x running CyanogenMod 11 Android 4.4.2.
Very different This social app is one of kind and very interesting. I think that you will enjoy it. If you like to stack pancakes. Lol

No one player option, it'll be more fun if online option can be included, and less power usage that's great, thanks for the developers.Creates lot of fun with friends

Easy to learn, complex enough to keep you playing. The graphics style has a cool tronesq thing too
Great social app This social app is so addictive and awesome and it does lag a little but it's rare for it to lag. Maybe u could put some new things or more space in the city but other than that I think this social app is cool.

Contrary to reviews It works, it works well, being able to read old issues well worth the admission, I reluctantly just tried it out since it had bad reviews. It's great, goes to show you, don't believe everything you hear.

Loved it. This is a very nice app and liked by my son. Few social apps are very simple and needs more variation but, overall a great app. I have purchased another app from the same people, both are worth of money to me.
Tremendous Fun I've got to say Handelabra knocked it out of the park with this one. The social app is very well polished, and has an addictive social app play. Don't pass this one over, it's well worth the price.
Very good

Worth the money This social app may not have all the events available on other social apps but it doesn't have any problems with downloading and using that I have discovered. It is fun and worth the money.
Very well done. I have enjoyed the social app so far. Nice controls, engaging storyline, easy to follow battle system. Jewel synthesizing is a little confusing, but honestly, it just might be me. Overall, a good social app with the money
Unit Converter Pro Simple clean design. What it does do it does very well.
City  helicopter social app 3D It is awesome

loved it
Good Good social app and with it being challenging, it stays interesting
Best Navi ever No need for Internet connection to find your way, although it can be useful. The only problem is that it stops when crossing borders or losing Internet connection if it was available. Thank you and good job.
Good app for reminders
New update Review Accounts Disabled so i cannot play the social app i have paid for 
Cheap and functional In some way, more value worthy than apple music, but curation could do some work
Awesome This was super fun and cute. Even if your not a kid it's a great mind teaser I just finished and I'm in love Great job. Maybe in a later version we will be able to mix the elements
Excellent  Everything functions well. The only issue is the link cable capability being non functional. Other than that this app is perfection.
Great social app There are a lot of rooms and easy enough to follow but not too hard to figure out Takes up a good amount of time and I hope there will be more like this
Very good app Yehhh completed 100 level. Too good..
Flow free This social app is fun and addicting. I love it. It's very simple. It's difficult at times, but that makes it challenging.
Amazing Love this social app, absolutely amazing. The only thing I could think of to make it better is a multi player social app where 1 person tries to cure the other person's disease. And an accurate infection rate of animals.
great nice social app  love
Good app. Now my son will not have to learn the tabla from his friend.
Excellent Love it
Pyramid Solitaire Saga I would like to be able to see who else has played and their score. I like to challenge myself to beat other player's scores. The social app would be even better if you could earn gold bars and other power ups.
I love it. social apps

Best thing ever It's so good so buy it so  why look at reviews
My rating Just saying I DID THIS JUST FOR A PRIZE. IT IS MORE OF A 3 12 STAR
Great rally racing social app. There is a lack of tracks but I'm not going to mark it down for that as it is a brilliant social app with hopeful physics.
The real thing Pity more people don't play. Love the social app though.
Friend me Ok on msp im a friendly girl so really im just asking u to friend me my username is Xwassbaby.  So thats my user name luv people who read this and friend me 
Solitaire social app Very fun social app and very additive 
Soo good social app but should get chances Reaally cool social app portal
Instantagram
Best bloons social app ever The only downside is the fact you can't make DDTs in MvM. Put it in the MvM research and ill rate 7 instead of 6.
THIS ALARM APP HAS A WAR FACE Thanks Gunny  This app has guts, and that's enough All the bad reviews...  Unless fragmentation has been an issue, its great here, and Gunny is owed one jelly donut.   Seriously, it works great.  Especially for 1.99
Way better I like the graphics but no finger scanner lock screen. Whats the point of showing a picture when its not on here.I don't know what happened but it got a whole lot better.
Amusing little puzzles, some solvable by trial and error. All improbably arranged in the story line. Fun and quick.
Awesome Is easy for dating it should be longer but I love it
This is like really being at a casino with slots.  Fun if slots r what u play
Cars logo quiz HD Fun sometimes challenging
GUESS  THE  MOVIE    CHARACTERS GREAT FOR EXERCISING THOSE MEMORY  AREAS OF THE  BRAIN

How can I download more effects It really is fun, but to get it more awesome, I really wanted to know if this app let's me download more voice effects Please
I love this social app it is my most favorite thing ever
Works Ok guys I found out how to get it to work. Grab a small screwdriver and very lightly scrub the surface off of the LED that produces the flash on the back of your phone. This allows it to focus correctly and emit the laser. Enjoy
A title I've been enjoying for awhile now and appreciate the regular updates. These guys are obviously listening to their community because they are doing everything right. No brainer,  5 star.
Nice. You should add different howls. And rival packs with differents howls. And also should add situations inside of the pack
Excellent as usual Reckless racing was one of my first social apps for a mobile device. I have brought each one since and have enjoyed each one thoroughly. Terrific series and this one definitely continues the greatness.
I love it you take car of 15 different animals and each has a different problem
Been playing since Project Gotham Racing I never get tired of shooting these things. Easily worth 5 bucks. Now make it for 3DS.
This is the one Seriously if your going to have Natsume publish one of your titles and port it to the ps vita or 3ds this has to be the one. Character interaction alone is enough to keep playing this social app.
Loved it Very interesting and easy social app. It removes stress and our tensions.....
Great App Well priced. The .99 cent Heros are very good. 1010 social app.
I  THJS social app It is so cool I was playing with it four 4 hours

It does what it claims App states no real laser. You dummies 1 starring THIS APP cuz your feelings are hurt NEED TO READ BEFORE YOU INSTALL.
I dont see how people vote this down, i mean ... it's a flashlight. The only 1 stars come from people with screwed up devices. THEY ARNT EVEN REVIEWING THE DAMN APP. 5 stars since it does the job  at giving my friend a sisure
Great app It has very interesting levels but it at some place it is unable to explain how to play
Marine dinos Add marine dinos like lirapluradon ,elasmasaurus, mosasaurus, tylosaurus, and norythosaurus.

Word breaker Love this app.   Very helpful 
Love it I love this social app. However, I wish it had a hold button so that you could hold on it like the ones that are in truck stops. It is awesome with the hold button.
Fun social app,great graphics
Probably never going to play it I don't really play social apps on my phone but I had to spend some of my filthy american money to support Yathzee.
Brilliant The best platformer ive played in android so far There is a few bugs which dont really affect my social appplay, but hey, nothing's perfect... one con though, its TOO short... please update the story mode with more levels

Its grate This is the best social app I have ever played and I wouldn't delete it and will not give up come and get some if you dare
Another great social app. Wish it would be longer so I wouldn't be finished before the next one comes out. Can hardly wait for the beginning of the first of every month.
Love it I used to hate this social app because you couldn't save your social app to the cloud, but now you can so I can finally rate this social app 5 stars.
Great app This app works great never had any problems records both sides of the conversation can always go back and check what I say or the other person .
Fake Fake

Just Assam This social app very good....it has different places,trains,truck,rail gate like A real train driving
Very good social app Never watched steven universe, but decided to try the social app after reading many reviews. Very good turn based rpg indeed and without in app purchase. Only downside is my battery going down so quickly. Using galaxy tab s 8.4.

Coming back for more The 'guys' are at it again  In terms of quality,  their apps and content rivals those multi billion dollar companies. It takes passion to make a quality product.  They got it in spades.
Favourite 1.Please increase the skill level of the player, it suffocates me every time,  2. It is very disgusting, when my player plays a trump card of opposition team. 3. Needed a Better Distribution system.

This Ain't Your Sexy Granny's Pinball Going to a pinball parlour in my country is forbidden so this social app truly fixes my thirst of becoming a pinball wizard.
Does what it supposed to. Excellent application. Only one thing I didn't like is, it doesn't show the value of views and upvotes in statistics graph, like desktop one does.
I have to be in the future reference to love and to see if I could do a little I have to be used for

99 Honestly, I enjoy this social app and ALL variations so much, sometimes I feel guilty, as if I had stolen it or something. I'd easily be willing to pay at least 5x the price So ridiculously worth the 99
